Data Science Group – The Fantastic 4
Proposal due 4/7/19


      The question that our group has decided to tackle is, “What factors are correlated to life expectancy of females as a percentage of males?” in hope to discover ways the lower life expectancies could be increased. We will do this by graphing to see the country outliers (both hi and low) and looking at those. We will then determine why the higher ones may exist and why the lower ones may as well, based on the other variables. Its relevance to a societal need is that, if it turns out that a proportionately lower or higher life expectancy for women has a strong correlation with another variable, that could lead us to determining how the life expectancy could be increased by either increasing or decreasing other factors. For example, if there is a higher mortality rate for women who go through childbirth, that would most likely lead to a lower life expectancy of women as a percentage of men for the region. Perhaps that region needs to address its healthcare system. This is just an example, but these are the sorts of correlations that we are interested in exploring, leading to being able to predict female life expectancies based on those correlations. If we had the means, we could then use our information on what causes the lower life expectancies to help the those in at-risk regions work their way up to having longer life expectancies. Our dataset is SOWC-2017-statistical-tables.pdf on our GitHub (State of the World’s Children dataset found on UNICEF website).
